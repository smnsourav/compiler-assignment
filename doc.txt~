Summary of classes used in this project
--------------------------------------------------

1)
CTextPane extends public class JTextPane
This is a text component that can be marked up with attributes that are represented graphically. 

2)
CEditorKit extends public class StyledEditorKit.
This is the set of things needed by a text component to be a reasonably functioning editor for some type of text document. This implementation provides a default implementation which treats text as colored text and provides a minimal set of actions for editing styled text.  

CEditorKit.getViewFactory()  fetches a factory that is suitable for producing views of models that are produced by this kit.

3)
CViewFactory implements public interface ViewFactory
This is a factory to create a view of the document subject. This is intended to enable color mapping over a document model.

4)
CView extends public class PlainView
The view represents each child element as a line of text.

5)
TextEditor implements the basic features of an editor like new, open, save, save as.
